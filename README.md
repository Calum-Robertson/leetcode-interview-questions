# leetcode-interview-questions
In this repository I am going through all of the Leetcode interview questions at:
https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-interview-questions/

In each module you will see a MySolution file and a BestSolution file.
MySolution is the implmementation I created to solve the problem.
BestSolution is the solution Leetcode provides with the best time complexity.

By doing this process for all the questions I hope to improve my ability to produce efficient code.
I also aim to become more familiar with the Java language and all of its functionality.
The end goal of this project is to become more confident and familiar with solving problems which will help me in the future when it comes to coding interviews.
